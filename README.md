**Clue Descriptions:**
Feeling Super Hungry: Distance between user click and the target point is minimum, the user is very close and almost there. <br>
Cannot Resist: User click is pretty close to the customer hence the dog feels strong smell and he cannot resist getting to the food. <br>
Can't wait to eat something: User click is near the burried food hence the dog feels that it is very close and can't wait to find the food.<br>
I feel hungry: User click has come close enough that the dog can smell the food and hence is feeling hungry (just dog being a dog).<br>
Something is distracting me: The user click is close enough that the dog feels some kind of smell and is now out for the hunt.<br>
Feeling Tired: The user click is so far that the dog doesn't even get a thought of eating something i.e. nothing to smell.<br>
Feeling Sleepy: The user click is nowhere close to the food so the dog doesn't get any smell and is feeling sleepy unaware that there is a bone waiting for it.<br><br>
